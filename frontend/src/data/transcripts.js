      **Doctor:** Good morning, Jane. Thanks for coming in. How have you been since our last visit?

      **Patient:** Morning, Dr. Smith. I'm doing much better, thank you. The new medication seems to be helping.

      **Doctor:** That's great to hear. Can you tell me more about that? How frequent are the migraines now?

      **Patient:** They've definitely decreased. I was getting them maybe three or four times a week, and now it's down to one or two at most. And they're not as intense.

      **Doctor:** Excellent. That's a significant improvement. What about side effects from the Topiramate? Anything to report?

      **Patient:** I've noticed some slight tingling in my hands, especially in the morning, but it's not too bothersome. It usually goes away after I get moving.

      **Doctor:** That's a common and usually harmless side effect. As long as it's not getting worse or accompanied by other symptoms, we can monitor it. How has your sleep been?

      **Patient:** It's been a bit irregular. I've had some trouble falling asleep a few nights this past week.

      **Doctor:** Okay, sleep is a crucial factor in managing migraines. I want you to focus on maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends. And make sure you're staying well-hydrated throughout the day.

      **Patient:** I can do that. Should I continue with the same dosage?

      **Doctor:** Yes, let's stick with the current plan. We'll continue the Topiramate at the same dose. I'd like to see you again in three months to re-evaluate. If the frequency stays low and the side effects remain minimal, we'll be in a very good place.

      **Patient:** Sounds good, Doctor. Thank you.

    "date": "2026-01-27T14:00:00Z",
    "summary": "Patient is a 45-year-old male here for his annual physical. Overall health is good. Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 135/85 mmHg. Discussed dietary changes, focusing on reducing sodium intake and increasing physical activity to 30 minutes of moderate exercise, 3-4 times a week. Lab work ordered for cholesterol and glucose levels. Follow-up in 1 month to check blood pressure.",

      **Doctor:** Hi John, good to see you. This is for your annual physical, correct?

      **Patient:** That's right, Dr. Adams. Just the yearly check-up.

      **Doctor:** Alright. Let's start with your vitals. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, at 135 over 85. It's been in the normal range in the past. Have you been feeling any stress lately?

      **Patient:** A bit more than usual, yes. Work has been demanding. And I'll admit, my diet hasn't been the best. Lots of takeout.

      **Doctor:** That can certainly contribute. I'm not concerned enough to start medication yet, but I'd like to see if we can bring that down with some lifestyle changes. Let's talk about your diet. How's your sodium intake?

      **Patient:** Probably higher than it should be. I do love salty snacks.

      **Doctor:** Let's work on cutting back on processed foods and reducing that sodium. I also want you to aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise, like brisk walking or cycling, three to four times a week.

      **Patient:** Okay, I can manage that.

      **Doctor:** Good. I'm also going to order some routine lab work to check your cholesterol and glucose levels, just to get a complete picture. We'll have you do that in the next few days. I'd like to see you back in a month to recheck your blood pressure.

      **Patient:** Sounds like a plan. Thanks, Dr. Adams.

    "title": "Consultation for Knee Pain",
    "patientName": "Emily White",
    "date": "2026-01-26T09:15:00Z",
    "summary": "Patient, a 28-year-old female, presents with right knee pain that started after a fall during a hiking trip two weeks ago. Pain is localized to the medial side of the knee and is worse with twisting motions. Physical exam shows tenderness over the medial collateral ligament (MCL). No signs of significant instability. Diagnosis is a Grade 1 MCL sprain. Recommended RICE protocol (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) and a course of NSAIDs for pain management. Referred to physical therapy to strengthen surrounding muscles.",
    "transcript": `
      **Doctor:** Emily, come on in. Tell me what's been going on with your knee.

      **Patient:** Hi Dr. Davis. I was hiking about two weeks ago and I slipped and fell. My right knee has been hurting ever since.

      **Doctor:** I see. Can you show me exactly where it hurts?

      **Patient:** It's right here, on the inside part of my knee.

      **Doctor:** Okay. And what kind of activities make it feel worse?

      **Patient:** It's worst when I try to pivot or twist on it. Walking on a flat surface is okay, but stairs are a bit painful.

      **Doctor:** (After physical examination) Alright, based on the exam, there's tenderness right over your medial collateral ligament, or MCL. The good news is that the knee feels stable, so it's likely just a mild sprain, what we call a Grade 1 injury.

      **Patient:** That's a relief. What should I do for it?

      **Doctor:** I want you to follow the RICE protocol: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. Avoid activities that cause pain. You can take an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory like Ibuprofen to help with the discomfort. I'm also going to give you a referral for physical therapy. They'll work with you to strengthen the muscles around the knee, which will help support the ligament as it heals.

      **Patient:** Okay, great. Thank you so much.
